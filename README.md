This is Super Game Shelf, a project I made while at Galvanize.

It is an app for logging all of your games both new and retro alike, then adding them to a list, it also shows you the metrics of how many games per comsole  you have in your collection on a pie chart. The front end was build in react, and the database has full CRUD functionality as well.
